script.xbmc.hue.stripped
========================

This is the stripped version of an XBMC add-on for Philips Hue lights. The stripped version is made to be portable, and works out of the box. Follow the installation instructions and you're ready to go. Unlike the full version it supports only 1 mode of operation, the so-called "theatre" mode.

### Theatre mode

Dims the the Philips Hue lights as soon as a movie starts playing, and turns the lights back on once the movie is done


Installation
------------

Copy the `script.xbmc.hue.stripped` folder to your XBMC add-ons. For Mac OSX users: `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons/`.

Restart XBMC and configure the add-on:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Enabled add-ons -> Services -> XBMC Philips Hue

Ambilight mode
--------------

If you'd like to use your lights in an ambilight mode you'll need the full version of this add-on, available at: https://github.com/cees-elzinga/script.xbmc.hue . In order for the ambilight mode to work you'll need to install the Python PIL library first.

Donations
---------
If you like the add-on, donations are always welcome :)
